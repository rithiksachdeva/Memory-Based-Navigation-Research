# MBN Steering Data Analysis
The algorithm takes in a HDF5 dataset which stores images and their associated steering data from a RC car and uses the values of how much a user uses the joystick to turn to understand where user decision points are. This uses elements of machine learning and signal processing to produce accurate landmarks/decision points.
